// Create a grocery shopping planner. You have a list of recipes that you want to make.
// Each recipe has a name and ingredients: amount of the ingredient (a simple integer)
// and the name of the ingredient.
// You also have a pantry, which contains various ingredients and their amounts.
// You have one pantry but multiple recipes. Your code should determine what needs to be purchased at the grocer to have enough
// ingredients for all the recipes you wish to make. It calculates whatâ€™s missing in your pantry to satisfy all the recipes.
// Create a Main class, a Recipe class (which is a single recipe), and a Pantry class. The main function creates a pantry object
// and list of recipe objects and determines the grocery list.
// There is no need for user input, you can create your own demo pantry and recipe data.
